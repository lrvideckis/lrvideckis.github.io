                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                Over a year ago, I started learning Hindi after becoming good
                friends with this group of Indian boys in college. I wanted to be
                able to hold a conversation in Hindi, as well as text/type in
                Hindi.
                </p>
                <p>
                Hindi uses a different script, namely
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari">Devanagari</a>.
                Although it's possible to write Hindi
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustani_orthography#The_Latin_Alphabet">using
                    the Latin/Roman alphabet</a> (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization">romanization</a>)
                I didn't want this. I wanted to be able
                to type in the real deal which is Devanagari. This meant learning
                the Devanagari script as well as some new Devanagari keyboard layout on mobile.
                </p>
                <p>I'm only interested in typing on mobile (not desktop, nor
                handwriting). It's 2023 - only relevant skills!</p>

                <h3>Learning About Devanagari</h3>
                <p>Devanagari a phonetic script, meaning:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>each character represents a specific sound</li>
                    <li>each sound has a specific character which represents it</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                By comparison, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet">Latin/Roman alphabet</a> is not phonetic:
                </p>
                <img src="snoop_tweet.png" alt="snoop tweet" style="width:350px;height:auto;">
                <br>
                <p>The non-phonetic-ness of English has some interesting
                consequences:</p>
                <p>We have spelling bee's. This is because in English,
                spelling is non-trivial. In phonetic languages like Hindi, spelling
                is trivial: you just sound out the word and that is also the
                spelling.</p>
                <p>Q: Do you think they have spelling bee's in India?</p>
                <details>
                    <summary>A:</summary>
                    Actually they do! (but in English)

                <p>
                You can spell English words different ways in Devanagari depending on the accent:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>niche can = नीश (neesh), निछ (nitch)</li>
                    <li>mobile can = मोबाईल (moh-bye-ul), मोबल (moh-buhl)</li>
                </ul>
                <hr>
                <p>The spelling for certain Hindi words can change as their pronunciation evolves:</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>word</th>
                        <th>formal spelling</th>

                        <td>snore</td>
                        <td>स्नोर</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <hr>
                <p>
                It's possible to be able to read/pronounce Devanagari out
                loud without understanding the meaning (by just sounding out the script).

                            <td>शब्द is stored like 'shubd' in my head, so my
                                brain sees 'shu' and thinks it is pronounced
                                like 'shoe'</td>
                        </tr>

                            <td>सर्फ (sirf)</td>
                            <td>In my head, सिर्फ is stored like 'sirf', and my
                                brain sees 'sir' and pronounces it like that
                                (e.g. like सर)</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                    <p>Conclusion: my brain stores words/sounds in some
                    disorganized way because of English's non-phonetic-ness. It
                    would be so sick to have a phonetic language as your mother
                    tongue becuase then your brain would be much better
                    organized.</p>

                <h3>Consonants Row</h3>
                <p>In Devanagari, the consonants are grouped by tongue/lip movements:</p>

                <p>For example, the "Labial" group's characters are all lip-movements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>प = p</li>
                    <li>फ = f</li>

                <p>Let's have a key for each consonant group.</p>

                    <li>Circled in <span style="color:#FFFF00">yellow</span> above: nasal consonants</li>
                    <li>Circled in <span style="color:#00FF00">green</span> above: the consonants which don't follow the pattern</li>

                <p>Here, each circled pair of consonants has the same tongue/lip movement.</p>

                <h3>Vowels Row</h3>
                <p>In Devanagari, the vowels are grouped by sound:</p>

                <a href="https://www.omniglot.com/writing/devanagari.htm">source</a>
                <p>For example, the "Rounded high back" group's characters are all "u"-sounds.</p>
                <p>Q: What is "diphthong"?</p>

                <p>Let's have a key for each vowel group. The vowel row also somewhat follows the "standard" vowel order:</p>
                <p>अ आ इ ई उ ऊ ऋ ए ऐ ओ औ</p>
                <p>It's analogous to the "standard" vowel order in English: AEIOU.
                Note neither of the "standard" vowel orders follows <a

                <p>Here, each circled pair of vowels has the same sound.</p>

                <h3>Alternative Layouts</h3>
                <p>Before creating my layout, I asked my Indian bros which
                layouts they used. They pretty much had 2 answers:</p>

                <p>1. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=gboard">GBoard</a>'s Hindi layout</p>
                <img src="hindi_gboard.png" alt="Gboard Hindi layout" style="width:540px;height:auto;">
                <p>2. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=swiftkey">SwiftKey</a>'s Hindi layout</p>
                <img src="swiftkey_hindi_layout.png" alt="Swiftkey Hindi layout.png" style="width:540px;height:auto;">

                <p>In hindsight, these are both great options. They both have
                similar organization. Both these keyboards have auto-complete,
                whereas Unexpected Keyboard (the app which I added my layout to)
                doesn't have auto-complete.</p>
                <p>If you already know Devanagari and simply want to type fast,
                auto-complete might be the move.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>I briefly considered the <a
                                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InScript_keyboard">Inscript
                                                    layout</a>, the official Devanagari layout for desktop.</p>
                <img src="inscript_layout.png" alt="Inscript layout" style="width:540px;height:auto;">
                <p>(<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=juloo.keyboard2">Google Play Store</a>)
                If you already know this layout from typing on desktop, this might be the move.</p>

                <h3>Is My Layout Better? (opinionated)</h3>
                <details>
                    <summary>short answer</summary>
                    Probably not; It is better for me specifically
                </details>
                <p>As mentioned above, Unexpected Keyboard doesn't have
                autocomplete/autocorrect. Also, Unexpected Keyboard uses swipe
                to type characters, whereas for GBoard and Swiftkey you can
                swipe to type entire words.</p>
                <p>To most people, these features are a pro of GBoard/Swiftkey.
                To me, someone learning Devanagari, I like how my layout forces
                me to type out words in full from memory. This forces me to
                learn the spelling (which is also the pronunciation) without
                the crutch of these features.</p>
                <p>In particular, this helped me learn the
                <a href="https://www.omniglot.com/writing/devanagari_conjuncts.php">conjunct consonants</a>.
                For example for the conjunct consonant त्य:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>With my layout, I'm forced to type the sequence त then ् then य. Here,  ् is the
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virama">Virama character</a>
                        and means that there is no vowel sound between त and य.
                        It also changes how the character looks visually (त्य
                        looks like the left half of त and then य).
                        <details>
                            <br>
                            <summary>One exception: the ज्ञ character</summary>
                            Its pronunciation is a bit controversial:
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            ज्ञ = ज + ् + ञ in unicode, so you would think its
                            pronunciation is half of ज, and then ञ, but this
                            is only true in Sanskrit.

                            In Hindi, ज्ञ is pronounced like ग + ् + ञ (= ग्ञ).
                            Hindi borrows many things from Sanskrit but doesn't
                            always keep everything the same.

                            For this reason alone, I type it via a single swipe
                            instead of the long way with the Virama character:
                            <img src="devanagari_exception_character.png" alt="devanagari exception character" style="width:500px;height:auto;">
                        </details>
                    </li>
                    <li>With GBoard, conjunct characters exist on different layers:
                        <img src="gboard_third_layer_conjunct_consonant.png" alt="gboard conjunct consonant" style="width:350px;height:auto;">
                        <br>
                        although GBoard also does have a key for  ् so you can
                        type it out in full if wanted.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>I like how my layout has large keys, thus I almost never mis-type.</p>
